======================== 
Pizzelle cioccolatte — chocolate pizzelle — are a delicious variation on
the usual almond, anise, and rum-flavored cookies. Snapping crisp yet
tender, pizzelle are a must-have at any Italian celebration.

   3 large eggs 
   1 cup sugar 
   1 teaspoon vanilla 
   ½ teaspoon espresso powder
  ⅜  teaspoon salt 
   ¼ cup Double-Dutch Dark Cocoa or Dutch-process cocoa
   2 teaspoons baking powder 
 1⅔  cups King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 
   ½ cup melted butter

Directions 
1) Beat together the eggs, sugar, vanilla, espresso powder, and salt
till smooth.  

2) Add the cocoa and baking powder, again beating till smooth.  

3) Add the flour, mixing till well combined. Add the melted butter,
again mixing till well combined.  

4) Bake pizzelle according to your pizzelle iron instructions. A
tablespoon cookie scoop works well for scooping batter onto the iron; a
level scoopful of batter is the right size for most standard pizzelle
makers.  

5) To make two-tone pizzelle: Prepare plain pizzelle batter, flavoring
it with 1/2 teaspoon hazelnut flavor, if desired. Using a teaspoon scoop
(which holds 2 level measuring teaspoons), drop a chestnut-sized ball of
vanilla batter just below center in the cooking area of the pizzelle
iron. Drop a slightly smaller ball of chocolate batter just above the
center line, nestling it right next to the vanilla batter. Close the
iron, and bake according to the manufacturer's directions.
