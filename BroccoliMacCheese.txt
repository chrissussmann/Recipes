Broccoli & White Cheddar Mac & Cheese
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Serves 2 as a main dish, 4 as a side

Buy blocks of cheese and grate it yourself. It makes a world of difference! The
pre-shredded stuff just doesn’t melt as smoothly. Plus, the more calories you
burn shredding cheese, the more mac & cheese you can eat.

Ingredients

  3 cups frozen baby broccoli florets
  ½ pound elbow macaroni
  ½ tablespoons unsalted butter
  2 tablespoons flour
1⅓  cups milk
  4 ounces sharp white cheddar cheese, grated
  2 ounces pepper jack cheese, grated
    salt to taste

Directions

Microwave broccoli florets in a large, microwave safe bowl according to package
instructions until tender (usually 4-5 minutes). Drain off any water and set
aside.

Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Add elbow macaroni. Boil
according to directions until al dente. Drain.

Meanwhile, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and whisk to
form a paste (roux). Cook 1-2 minutes to eliminate raw flour taste. Slowly pour
in milk, whisking briskly to remove lumps. Continue cooking over medium heat,
whisking constantly, until milk mixture thickens. Remove from heat and whisk in
shredded cheese. Add salt to taste.

Add drained macaroni back to pot. Pour cheese sauce over macaroni, add
broccoli, and stir to combine. Devour.
