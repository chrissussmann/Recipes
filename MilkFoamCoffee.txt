Find a jar with a lid and fill it with as much milk as you normally like in
your coffee (or other hot beverage!). The milk should fill the jar no more than
half way to allow room for the foam.


Shake the jar with the lid on as hard as you can until the milk has become
frothy and doubled in size. This takes us about 30 seconds.


Take the lid off and microwave for another 30 seconds. The foam will rise to
the top of the milk and the heat from the microwave will help stabilize it.
Pour the milk into your coffee using a spoon to hold back the foam. Then scoop
the foam on top!


Although the milk will add that soft, creamy texture you've come to expect from
your favorite local coffee shop, it won't have the sweet tang that's usually a
bi-product of the more traditional steaming method. While you're making the
most of your at-home coffee shop, read up on making other coffee shop
addictions at home to maximize your out of pocket spending.
