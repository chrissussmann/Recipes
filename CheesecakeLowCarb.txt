   2 Eggs
   2 tsp vanilla extract
  1½ cups sour cream
   ½ cup Splenda granules (or other artificial sweetener)
  16 oz cream cheese, softened. 
   2 T melted butter.

In a large bowl, blend together eggs, vanilla, sour cream and splenda. 
Slowly add butter and cream cheese. 

Spoon about ½ cup mix into another bowl and add raspberry flavoring
(sugar free, any flavor) Mix well. 

Spoon remaining mix into a 10 inch spring release pan or 12
ramekins.  Add dollops of raspberry batter on top and swirl thru. 

If desired, you can make a crust from 1 ½ cups ground almonds, ¼ cup
splenda and ¼ cup butter. Mix all together like you would graham cracker
crust and line pan or ramekins. (calculations do not include crust)

Bake in 350 degree oven for 20-25 min if cooking ramekins, 35-40 min for
spring pan. This will not look done, but will firm up when refrigerated. 

Place ramekins in a water bath or place a shallow pan with water in
overn below the pan or ramekins. 

Garnish with fresh raspberries and whipped cream if desired (not
included in counts) 
This can be frozen.
