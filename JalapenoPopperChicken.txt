Jalapeño Popper Chicken


Serves 2
Ingredients


    1/2 cup panko
      2 tsp. canola oil
1.5 – 2 tsp. taco seasoning or mixture in notes*
      1 egg
  2 oz. reduced fat cream cheese
    1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese (we used 2%)
    1-2 jalapeño peppers, seeds and ribs removed, minced
      2 chicken breasts


Directions


Preheat the oven to 375 and place an ovenproof rack onto a rimmed baking dish.
Spray with cooking oil.


In a small skillet over medium heat, combine the panko with the canola oil.
Cook, stirring often, until the panko is golden and crispy. Place in a shallow
bowl or dish. To the panko, add the taco seasoning* and stir to combine.


In another shallow bowl or dish, lightly beat an egg. In a small bowl, combine
the cream cheese, cheddar cheese, and jalapeños.


Using a small utility knife, cut a pocket into the side of each chicken breast,
or horizontally slice the chicken through the center, until it is almost
butterflied. Season the chicken lightly with salt and pepper, and then divide
the cream cheese mixture evenly between each chicken breast’s pocket. Use
toothpicks to secure, if necessary.


Dip the chicken pieces one at a time first into the egg, and then into the
panko mixture, making sure to coat the chicken completely. Place the chicken on
the prepared baking rack and cook for about 25-30 minutes, or until chicken is
cooked through.
