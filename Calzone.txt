Calzone
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
       Olive oil
 ½ yellow onion, thinly sliced
   Pinch of salt
 ½ cup butternut squash, cubed
 ½ cup broccolini, trimmed
 ½ cup cremini mushrooms, sliced
 1 garlic cloves, minced
 1 12 ounce prepared pizza dough
 3 tablespoons jarred marinara sauce
 1 4 ounce mozzarella ball (low-moisture-not water packed!)

In a medium skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add thinly sliced
onions and pinch of salt. Cook onions for 30 minutes, or until onions
are browned and caramelized.

While the onions are cooking, pre-heat oven to 400F. Place cubed
butternut squash on a baking sheet and toss with a teaspoon of olive oil
and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast for 15 minutes, or until soft.
Remove and set aside.

When onions are caramelized, add broccolini and cremini mushrooms and
sauteé for 5-10 minutes. Add garlic to the top and cook just until
fragrant.

Lightly flour your work surface and roll out pizza dough to a 1/8-inch
thick circle. Transfer pizza dough to a piece of parchment. Add the
tomato sauce to one half. Top with broccolini/mixture. Add the butternut
squash and then finish it off with a few slices of mozzarella.

Fold dough in half, over filling, and crimp as desired to seal. Transfer
parchment with calzone to a baking sheet. Using a knife, slice a hole in
the top. This will allow steam to escape as it bakes. Place it in the
oven and cook until dough is puffed up and golden brown, 15-20 minutes.
