Southwest Quinoa Salad


Ingredients For Salad:
  2 cups uncooked quinoa
  1 tsp Better Than Bouillon
 1/4 tsp cumin
   1 Lb grilled chicken, chopped
   1 red bell pepper, diced
 1/2 cup green onions, thinly sliced
   1 cup chopped cilantro
1 15 oz can black beans, drained and rinsed
1 1/2 cups frozen corn, semi thawed
    2 Hass avocados


 Ingredients For Dressing:
    3 Tbs extra virgin olive oil
    3 Tbs lemon juice
    3 Tbs rice vinegar
    1 Tbs sugar
   1/2 tsp kosher salt
   1/2 tsp cumin
   1/2 tsp chili powder
       *Whisk all ingredients in a small bowl and set aside


Directions:
Cook quinoa according to package directions. Add the Better Than Boullion and 1/4 tsp cumin to the boiling water. I like to use Ancient Harvest Brand quinoa because it's pre-washed.
When quinoa is ready, fluff it with a fork and turn it out into a large bowl to cool. While quinoa is cooling, chop your bell pepper, green onion, cilantro, and chicken. Add all chopped ingredients along with your corn and black beans to a large salad bowl. Gently mix in the cooled quinoa. Drizzle with dressing and toss to coat. Refrigerate for an hour so that all the flavors have time to meld. Right before serving, chop your avocado and gently fold in to salad.
