Cranberry Pistachio Energy Bites

Prep Time: 15 minutes
Total Time: 15 minutes
Yield: About 30 1-inch balls

Ingredients

    8 oz. (about 1 packed cup) chopped dates
  1/2 cup honey
    1 Tbsp. chia seeds (optional)
    1 Tbsp. ground flax seeds or wheat germ
      pinch of salt
1 1/2 cups old-fashioned oats (dry, not cooked)
    1 cup shelled pistachio nuts
    1 cup dried cranberries
  1/3 cup white chocolate chips (optional)

Method

Combine the dates, honey, chia seeds, flax seeds and salt in a food processor,
and pulse until smooth and combined. You should be able to stir the mixture --
if it is too thick, add in another tablespoon or two of honey.

Transfer the mixture to a large bowl, and stir in the oats, pistachios, dried
cranberries, and white chocolate chips until evenly combined. Cover and
refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Once the mixture is cool (and easier to work with), use a spoon or cookie scoop
to shape it into your desired size of energy balls. (Mine were about 1-inch in
diameter.) Alternately, you can line a small baking pan with parchment paper,
and press the mixture evenly into the pan, let it cool, and then cut into bars.

Store covered in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. (Storing them in the
refrigerator especially helps the energy bites hold their shape.)
