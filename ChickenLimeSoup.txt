Chicken + Lime Soup

  2 Tbsp olive oil
  1 medium onion, diced
  2 stalks, diced
  1 Tbsp minced garlic
  1 lb. chicken breast
  6 Cups low sodium chicken broth
  1 15 oz can diced tomatoes with chiles
  1 Tsp oregano
1/2 Tbsp cumin
  1 lime
1/2 bunch cilantro

Cut up your onion and celery into small pieces.  Cook the onion, celery, and
minced garlic in olive oil over medium heat until tender (about 5 minutes).

Cut any excess fat off chicken.  Add the chicken breast, chicken broth, canned
tomatoes, oregano, and cumin to the pot.  Bring everything to a boil over high
heat.  Once everything is bubbling, reduce the heat to low, place the lid on
top, and let simmer for one hour.

After the pot is done simmering, remove chicken breast from the pot and use two
forks to shred.  Return shredded chicken to the pot.  Squeeze juice from one
lime into the soup.

Rinse cilantro and cut into small pieces.  Add to the soup,  give a quick stir
and stir it up.
