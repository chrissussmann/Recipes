Oat Muffins

Makes 12 Muffins

Do not use quick or instant oats in this recipe. Walnuts may be substituted 
for the pecans. The easiest way to grease and flour the muffin tin is with a 
baking spray with flour.

INGREDIENTS

TOPPING
  1/2 cup (1 1/2 ounces) old-fashioned rolled oats
  1/3 cup (1 2/3 ounces) all-purpose flour
  1/3 cup pecans, chopped fine
  1/3 cup packed (2 1/3 ounces) light brown sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons ground cinnamon
  1/8 teaspoon salt
    4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
MUFFINS
    2 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus 6 tablespoons melted
    2 cups (6 ounces) old-fashioned rolled oats
1 3/4 cups (8 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
  3/4 teaspoon baking powder
  1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/3 cups packed (9 1/3 ounces) light brown sugar
1 3/4 cups milk
    2 large eggs, beaten

INSTRUCTIONS
1. FOR THE TOPPING: Combine oats, flour, pecans, sugar, cinnamon, and salt in
medium bowl. Drizzle melted butter over mixture and stir to ­thoroughly
combine; set aside.

2. FOR THE MUFFINS: Grease and flour 12-cup muffin tin. Melt 2 tablespoons
butter in 10-inch skillet over medium heat. Add oats and cook, stirring
frequently, until oats turn golden brown and smell of cooking popcorn, 6 to 8
minutes. Transfer oats to food processor and process into fine meal, about 30
seconds. Add flour, salt, baking powder, and baking soda to oats and pulse
until combined, about 3 pulses.

3. Stir 6 tablespoons melted butter and sugar together in large bowl until
smooth. Add milk and eggs and whisk until smooth. Using whisk, gently fold half
of oat mixture into wet ingredients, tapping whisk against side of bowl to
release clumps. Add remaining oat mixture and continue to fold with whisk until
no streaks of flour remain. Set aside batter for 20 minutes to thicken.
Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees.

4. Using ice cream scoop or large spoon, divide batter equally among prepared
muffin cups (about ½ cup batter per cup; cups will be filled to rim). Evenly
sprinkle topping over muffins (about 2 tablespoons per muffin). Bake until
toothpick inserted in center comes out clean, 18 to 25 minutes, rotating muffin
tin halfway through baking.

5. Let muffins cool in muffin tin on wire rack for 10 minutes. Remove muffins
from muffin tin and serve or let cool completely before serving.
