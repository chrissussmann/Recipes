## Instructions
<pre>
    Light grease a large sheet pan with non-stick cooking spray. Cut chicken
and vegetables into strips. Lay the vegetables evenly on the pan and place the
chicken on top of them.  Preheat oven to 425&deg;F.  Combine seasoning
ingredients together in a small bowl. Stir well to combine. Sprinkle most of
the seasoning over the chicken, and some of it over the vegetables as well.
Spoon minced garlic on top of the chicken and drizzle olive oil over the entire
pan. Toss everything well and spread it into an even layer across the pan.
Cook for 15-20 minutes or until chicken is cooked through (165 degrees if you
test with a thermometer). Wrap the flour tortillas in foil and place them in
the oven to warm during the last 5 minutes of cooking.  Remove everything from
the oven. Squeeze fresh lime juice over the chicken and vegetables and sprinkle
with cilantro. Serve in warm tortillas with extra toppings, if desired.
