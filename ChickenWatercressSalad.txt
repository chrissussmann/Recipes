-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ingredients
 	
 ¼ cup olive oil, plus more for grill
 ¼ cup fresh lemon juice (from 2 lemons)
   Coarse salt and ground pepper
 2 boneless, skinless chicken breast halves (6 to 8 ounces each)
 ¼ teaspoon ground cumin
 2 bunches watercress, thick stems trimmed
 1 bunch radishes, trimmed and thinly sliced
 1 avocado, diced

Serves 4 | Prep time: 30 minutes | Total time: 30 minutes
 	

Heat grill to medium-high. In a large bowl, combine oil and lemon juice;
season dressing with salt and pepper.  Lay chicken flat. Holding a sharp
knife parallel to work surface, split each chicken breast in half
horizontally. Cover with plastic wrap and pound each piece with the flat
side of a meat mallet or the bottom of a small pan until inch thick.
Drizzle with 2 tablespoons dressing and sprinkle with cumin.  Clean and
oil grill. Grill chicken until cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side.
To bowl with dressing, add watercress, radishes, and avocado and toss to
combine. Serve chicken topped with watercress salad.
