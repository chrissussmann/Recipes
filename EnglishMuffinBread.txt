English Muffin Bread


We love English muffins for their crunchy crust, chewy interior, and many nooks
and crannies. We looked for the same great qualities in a quick, easy loaf
bread.  


MAKES 2 LOAVES


INGREDIENTS


   Cornmeal
 5 cups (27 1/2 ounces) bread flour
4½ teaspoons instant or rapid-rise yeast
 1 tablespoon sugar
 2 teaspoons salt
 1 teaspoon baking soda
 3 cups whole milk, heated to 120 degrees


INSTRUCTIONS


1. Grease two 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pans and dust with cornmeal. Combine flour,
yeast, sugar, salt, and baking soda in large bowl. Stir in hot milk until
combined, about 1 minute. Cover dough with greased plastic wrap and let rise in
warm place for 30 minutes, or until dough is bubbly and has doubled.


2. Stir dough and divide between prepared loaf pans, pushing into corners with
greased rubber spatula. (Pans should be about two-thirds full.) Cover pans with
greased plastic and let dough rise in warm place until it reaches edge of pans,
about 30 minutes. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 375
degrees.


3. Discard plastic and transfer pans to oven. Bake until bread is well browned
and registers 200 degrees, about 30 minutes, rotating and switching pans
halfway through baking. Turn bread out onto wire rack and let cool completely,
about 1 hour. Slice, toast, and serve.
