Spanish-Style Garlic Shrimp
---------------------------------------


    14 medium garlic cloves, peeled
  1 lb large (31-40) Shrimp, peeled, deveined, and tails removed
     8 Tablespoons olive oil
   1/2 teaspoon table salt
     1 bay leaf
1 (2") piece mild dried chili, such as New Mexico, roughly broken,
       seeds included
 1 1/2 teaspoon sherry vinegar  
     1 Tablespoon chopped fresh parsley leaves


Mince 2 garlic cloves with chef's knife or garlic press.  Toss minced
garlic with shrimp, 2 tablespoons olive oil, and salt in medium bowl.
Let shrimp marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes.


Meanwhile, using flat side of chef's knife, smash 4 garlic cloves.  Heat
smashed garlic with remaining 6 tablespoons olive oil in 12" skillet
over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until garlic is light
golden brown, 4 to 7 minutes.  Remove pan from heat and allow oil to
cool to room temperature.  Using slotted spoon, remove smashed garlic
from skillet and discard.


Thinly slice remaining 8 cloves garlic.  Return skillet to low heat and
add sliced garlic, bay leaf, and chili.  Cook, stirring occasionally,
until garlic is tender but not browned, 4 to 7 minutes.  (If garlic has
not begun to sizzle after 3 minutes, increase heat to medium-low.)
Increase heat to medium-low; add shrimp with marinade to pan in single
layer.  Cook shrimp, undisturbed, until oil starts to gently bubble,
about 2 minutes.  Using tongs, flip shrimp and continue to cook until
almost cooked through, about 2 minutes longer.  Increase heat to high
and add sherry vinegar and parsley.  Cook, stirring constantly, until
shrimp are cooked though and oil is bubbling vigorously, 15-20 seconds.
Serve immediately.
