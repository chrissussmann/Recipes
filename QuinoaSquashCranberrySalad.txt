Quinoa salad with roasted butternut squash, dried cranberries, pepitas and a
simple citrus honey dressing.


Ingredients:


   1 butternut squash, peeled, seeded, and chopped into 1/2-inch cubes
     Olive oil
     Salt and freshly ground black pepper, for seasoning squash
   2 cups quinoa
   4 cups water
     Pinch of salt
   1 cup dried cranberries
   1 cup pepitas


For the Citrus Honey Dressing:


    Juice of 3 large oranges
    Zest of 1 large orange
1/4 cup olive oil
  1 tablespoon honey
    Salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste


Directions:


1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Place butternut squash on a large baking
sheet. Drizzle with olive oil. Toss until squash is well coated. Season with
salt and pepper. Roast the squash for 30 minutes, turning once, until tender.


2. While the butternut squash is roasting, cook the quinoa. Add quinoa, water,
and salt to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 5
minutes. Turn the heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until water
is absorbed. Remove from heat and fluff with a fork. Let cool quinoa cool to
room temperature.


3. In a large bowl, combine quinoa, butternut squash, dried cranberries, and
pepitas. In a small bowl, whisk together the orange juice, zest, olive oil, and
honey. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Drizzle over quinoa salad. Toss
until ingredients are well dressed. Season with salt and pepper, to taste.


Note-you can use agave instead of the honey to make a vegan salad.
