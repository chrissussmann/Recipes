Honey Mustard Chicken with Bacon and Mushrooms
From your Everyday Home Cook


1-1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts
    1/4 cup Dijon mustard
    1/4 cup honey
      1 teaspoon lemon juice
      2 cups fresh mushrooms, sliced
   8-12 slices bacon, partially cooked
      1 cup grated cheddar cheese
      1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped
        salt, pepper, paprika


Make marinade by mixing together mustard, honey, and lemon juice.  Add
chicken breasts and refrigerate for two hours.  Preheat oven to 350
degrees F.  Heat a small amount of oil (canola or vegetable) in a
skillet and add chicken breasts, discarding marinade.  Cook chicken a
few minutes on each side.  Set aside.  Scrape out most of the juices
from the pan, and add mushrooms.  Saute mushrooms until tender (a few
minutes).  Assemble chicken in a large baking dish: chicken, then bacon,
then mushrooms, then cheese.  Bake at 350 degrees F for about 20
minutes, until chicken is cooked through.  Sprinkle with chopped parsley
before serving.
