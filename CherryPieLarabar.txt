Homemade Cherry Pie LÄRABAR 

1 1/4 cups medjool dates, pitted
1 1/4 cups dried cherries
1 1/2 cups almonds, toasted (optional)

To toast the almonds, place them on a baking sheet and bake at 400°F for ten
minutes.  Remove from oven and transfer the almonds to a bowl or plate to cool.
Place dates and cherries in a food processor and pulse until a gooey semi-paste
has formed (you want some bits of fruit, but not huge pieces). Empty the dried
fruit into a large mixing bowl. Put the almonds in the food processor and pulse
to coarse bits. You don’t want to make this a powder. Empty the almonds into
the mixing bowl with the dried fruit. Knead the dried fruit and almonds
together until combined and evenly distributed.  Press the mixture into the
bottom of an 8-inch or 9-inch square pan to about 1/2-inch thickness.
Refrigerate the mixture for 30 minutes. Invert the pan’s contents onto a
cutting board and slice to desired size. Makes about a dozen 1.5- x 3.5-inch
bars with a few odd pieces leftover
