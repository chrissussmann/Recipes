Marsh mellows

 1/4 cup cornstarch
 1/3 cup confectioners sugar
   1 envelope unflavored gelatin
 1/3 cup water
 2/3 cup granulated sugar
 1/2 cup light corn syrup
     Pinch of salt
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Sift the cornstarch and confectioners sugar into a bowl.  Lightly grease an 8x8 
inch backing dish ans sprinkle one tablespoon of the  cornstarch and sugar
mixture in it.  Tile the pan to coat.  Leave any excess in the pan.

Sprinkle the gelatin into the water in a small saucepan and let soak for five
minutes.  Add the granulated sugar and stir over low heat until the gelatin and
sugar dissolve.

In the large bowl of an electric mixer, combine the gelatin mixture, corn syrup,
salt and vanilla and beat for 15 minutes on high speed, until peaks form.

Spread the fluffy mixture in the prepared dish and smooth the top.  Leave for
two hours or until set.  With a wet knife, cut the marshmallow mixture into quarters
and loosen around the edges.  Sprinkle the remaining cornstarch ans sugar 
mixture on a backing sheet and invert the marshmallow blocks onto it.  Cut each
quarter into nine pieces and roll each in the starch and sugar.

Place the marshmallows on a cake rack covered with paper towels and let them
stand over night to dry the surface slightly.  Store airtight.  The marshmallows
will keep for a month.
